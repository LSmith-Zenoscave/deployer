Warning!!! The script did not succeed (possibly)
If that is the case, you have a few options
1. Run the failed command manually and resume the unnattended deployment:
i.e.
$ {next_command["command"]}
$ deployer-fsm -u -s '{next_command.get(0, None)}'

2. Rerun from the same starting point as the failed command:
$ deployer-fsm -u -s '{curr_idx}'

3. Do either of the above but with repl feed back (remove the -u flag).
$ {next_command["command"]}
$ deployer-fsm -s '{next_command.get(0, None)}'
~or~
$ deployer-fsm -s '{curr_idx}'
